## Summary Roll-Up

-  P0 (Critical): Focus first on monitoring, backups & recovery, RDS failover drill, encryption & CloudTrail, quota increases, tagging standard, Auto Scaling, CDN, secrets management, logging & alarm foundations.
-  P1 (High): Scaling enhancements (Spot strategy), CI/CD automation, caching layer, IAM least privilege refinements, cost governance, connection pooling, SSM operations, game days.
-  P2 (Nice to have / strategic): Optimization, deeper governance, advanced observability, sustainability refinements, serverless migration opportunities.

## Next 30-Day Execution Snapshot (Suggested)

1. Week 1: CloudWatch alarms, backup plan + test, encryption/TLS verification, tagging baseline, quota increase requests.
2. Week 2: ASG implementation, CDN enablement, secrets manager integration, RDS failover drill + runbook.
3. Week 3: CI/CD pipeline (infrastructure + application), cached layer design decision, cost budgets & alerts.
4. Week 4: Spot strategy proposal, connection pooling (RDS Proxy), logging enrichment (structured JSON), prepare game day outline.
